/// Given a card, convert the card to the absolute deck ordered value.

/// Since it is quite possible that cards of the same value but of different
/// suits are selected, we will have to map all the cards to have unique values.
/// In this fashion, all the cards that have a face value of 6 will have a
/// unique value. For example, _6C_, _6D_, _6H_, and _6S_ all have a face value
/// of 6 and are of different suits. We cannot order these cards as low, middle,
/// and high unless we factor in the suits. Recall that we'll rank the suits in
/// alphabetical order so _6C_ < _6D_ < _6H_ < _6S. Mapping all the cards to
/// values between 1 and 52 is achieved by recognizing that there are 4 of each
/// card and we can assign a value to each suit: clubs are 1, diamonds are 2,
/// hearts are 3, and spades are 4.
///
/// Given a card, separate the card into it's _face value_ and _suit_. Map the
/// _face value_ to a value between 0 and 12, let's call this _numeric value_.
/// Using the suit, lookup the _suit's offset_; clubs are 1, diamonds are 2,
/// hearts are 3, and spades are 4. Finally, calculate the _deck value_ using
/// the formula _numeric value_ * 4 + _suit's offset_.
///
/// Working with a deck that is ordered by value first and suit second, you'll
/// have a deck that is ordered as _AC, AD, AH, AS, 1C, 1D, 1H, 1S,…, QC, QD,
/// QH, QS, KC, KD, KH, KS_. This means _AC_ is 1, _AD_ is 2, _KH_ is 51, and
/// _KS_ is 52. Consider the following examples.
///
/// * _AC_ is _numeric value_ of 0 and a _suit's offset_ of 1 thus 0 * 4 + 1 = 0
/// * _AS_ is _numeric value_ of 0 and a _suit's offset_ of 4 thus 0 * 4 + 4 = 4
/// * _6C_ is _numeric value_ of 5 and a _suit's offset_ of 1 thus 5 * 4 + 1 =
/// 21
/// * _6D_ is _numeric value_ of 5 and a _suit's offset_ of 2 thus 5 * 4 + 2 =
/// 22
/// * _6H_ is _numeric value_ of 5 and a _suit's offset_ of 3 thus 5 * 4 + 3 =
/// 23
/// * _6S_ is _numeric value_ of 5 and a _suit's offset_ of 4 thus 5 * 4 + 4 =
/// 24
/// * _QH_ is _numeric value_ of 11 and a _suit's offset_ of 3 thus 11 * 4 + 3 =
/// 47
/// * _KS_ is _numeric value_ of 12 and a _suit's offset_ of 4 thus 12 * 4 + 4 =
